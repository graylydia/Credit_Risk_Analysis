# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview of the Project
### Purpose
We were tasked with predicting credit card risk through the use of machine learning algorithms. Good loans easily outnumber risky loans so we aimed to predict good candidates for loans which would lead to lower default rates. We utilized the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample the data. The ClusterCentroids algorithm was used to under sample the data and the SMOTEENN algorithm was used to over- and under sample the data. To predict credit risk with reduced bias, the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier algorithms were used. The performance of these approaches can be compared then evaluated to determine which, if any, algorithm is best to predict credit risk.
